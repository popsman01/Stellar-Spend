## Adding New Scripts

When adding new scripts:

1. Follow the naming convention: `verb-noun.ext` (e.g., `deploy-contract.sh`)
2. Add documentation to this README.md
3. If the script is referenced in package.json, update the entry
4. Ensure scripts are executable: `chmod +x script.sh`
5. Add error handling and logging for production scripts
